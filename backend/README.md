# How To Use

You're in a venv, which I set up because it's best practice, but it's annoying imo. Anyway,
do `Ctrl + Shift + P` and type `Python: Select Interpreter` and select the one that says venv 
somewhere in the name. This will make your VSCode terminal show a `(venv)` prompt and should also,
hopefully, make it recognise `aiohttp`.

Run the backend with 

```
(venv) $ python3 main.py
```

`(venv) $` indicates that you are inside the virutalenv.
